# Isometric World Builder

See the [rive-gamekit-examples](../../README.md) main README for how to get access to the Rive GameKit.

## About

A cute world builder with an isometric perspective. Make use of the selection panel at the bottom to create your world. There are a number of different variations you can cycle through by clicking on a placed tile again.

This example makes use of the Rive GameKit to render the game scene, and Rive Flutter Runtime to render the UI selection panel.


## How to Run

Note that you'll need access to Rive GameKit to run this example. Once you do:

1. Clone the `rive-gamekit-examples` repo down to your machine
2. `cd games/isometric_world_builder`
3. Run `flutter create .` to create all the platform-specific folder builds and projects
4. To run the application as a macOS app, run `flutter run -d macos`

### Platform Considerations
Before running locally, please take note of the [supported platforms and versions](https://help.rive.app/rive-gamekit/overview#supported-platforms-rive-gamekit) section in the Rive GameKit docs.
