# Centaur

See the [rive-gamekit-examples](../../README.md) main README for how to get access to the Rive GameKit.

## About

Centaur is a Flutter example app using the Rive GameKit to show how to render multiple artboards from one Rive file onto a scene. It features a centaur where you can move left and right with the `A` and `D` keys, control its bow and body position following your cursor, and click to fire multiple arrow artboard instances at multiple apple artboard instances.

## How to Run

Note that you'll need access to Rive GameKit to run this example. Once you do:

1. Clone the `rive-gamekit-examples` repo down to your machine
2. `cd games/centaur`
3. Run `flutter create .` to create all the platform-specific folder builds and projects
3. To run the application as a macOS app, run `flutter run -d macos`


### Platform Considerations
Before running locally, please take note of the [supported platforms and versions](https://help.rive.app/rive-gamekit/overview#supported-platforms-rive-gamekit) section in the Rive GameKit docs.
